  <h1>Conclusion </h1>
  <p>In conclusion, our hypothesis was slightly correct, we did manage to find a small correlation between the two factors. However, we suspected that it is more of an indirect correlation. The more hours spent on social media, the later you stay up and the less sleep you get. This conclusion matches up with what is stated by sleep station.org which state that looking at social media before going to sleep can reduce your quality of sleep and make it harder to sleep (Sunter, 2021).  We’ve learned that using your device before sleeping (which the majority of people according to our and The National Sleep Foundation) is harmful to your health and causes you to get bad quality sleep. Ways in which we can improve our study is by asking people whether or not they are on social media right before sleeping, to be certain that social media is what is keeping them up at night, we could require each participant to use a smartwatch or another device to ensure that the number of hours sleeping is more accurate, and requiring participants to check their built-in phone tracking feature to ensure that the numbers of hours spent on social media is also valid. Finally, it would have been better if we could have gotten a larger dataset with a wider variety of people to get a better idea of the whole population. As for further investigations, our research did expose some interesting facts, like the fact that people in this school either underestimate the amount of sleep they get, or there is a serious problem here, which should be looked deeper into. We also believe that this data could be useful to other people doing research on sleep deprivation. This study could also be very helpful to students who don’t realize that being on their devices 30 minutes before going to bed is not a good idea.
