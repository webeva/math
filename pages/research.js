   <p>Before we get into our research it is important to know the importance of sleep and how much sleep is recommended for each age group. Sleep is a crucial aspect of the growth and development of teenagers and children. Sleeping can help reduce the risks of diseases and increase immunity, ensure a healthy functional brain, and helps maintain a healthy weight (Why is sleep important?, 2021). According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine children between 6 - 12 years old require 9 - 12 hours of sleep per day while teenagers should strive for 8 - 10 hours of sleep per day (Sleep in Middle and high school students, 2020). However, it is reported that about 72.7% of high school students don’t get enough sleep on school nights while 57.8% of middle school students also don’t get enough school during school nights (Sleep in Middle and high school students, 2020).

   <p>Not getting the right amount of sleep can have several harmful effects on your physical and mental health. Some of the most significant effects caused by a lack of sleep include high blood pressure, diabetes, and increased chances of heart attacks, heart failure, or stroke (Cleveland Clinic, 2022).
</p>
<p>Additionally, not sleeping enough might lead to obesity, and depression (Cleveland Clinic, 2022). Short-term problems of a lack of sleep are shown below: 
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling very sleepy and tired throughout the day</li>
        <li>Degrading memory or ability to critically think </li>
        <li>Greater chance of car accidents for students who drive</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The use of social media before going to bed can have numerous harmful effects on the amount of sleep you get and the quality of it. Before going to bed, you should not check social media, write emails, or read the news as using gadgets at night might disrupt sleep due to the stimulating effects of the light from screens (Newsom, 2022). The blue light released from screens has the biggest effect on sleep, however, all light can disrupt our circadian rhythms, the  24-hour cycles that regulate functions (Newsom, 2022). Blue light can keep parts of our brain active when we are trying to go to sleep.
</p><p>Those who check their phones after going to sleep may be more affected by blue light exposure. About 21% of adults claim to wake up in the middle of the night to check their phones (Newsom, 2022). The use of social media right before bed can have a detrimental impact on how much and how well you sleep. The more you check your phone, the more blue light, the worse the sleep level.
</p><p>
	Additionally, it may shorten your sleep duration and prevent you from feeling rested the following day. To give your body time to relax and get ready for bed, try to restrict or completely stop your usage of social media in the hours before night. Keep your phone out of the bedroom, if at all possible!
